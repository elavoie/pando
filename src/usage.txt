usage: pando MODULE [OPTIONS] ITEM1, ITEM2, ...

Processes items using the module and output the resulting values on the
standard output. Processing happens on volunteer processes in a web browser on
the same or on another machine.  Volunteers may join at any time and will be
given newer jobs as long as they stay available.  They may stop before
finishing a given job in which case the incomplete job will be transparently
reassigned to another volunteer.

MODULE is the file path to a Node.js module. The module must export an object
with a property '/pando/1.0.0'. This property must be a function that takes a
single value and a callback as arguments.

OPTIONS (default?):
    --http=PORT (true, PORT=5000) 
                Serve volunteer code through http.
                (volunteers will connect back through a websocket)

    --heroku    (false)           
                Serve volunteer code through http on a public heroku server.
                (volunteers will connect back through a websocket)

    --local     (false)
                Does not open to volunteers but loads the module, and directly
                processes items one-by-one.
                Useful for testing the module on a few sample items.

ITEMS can be numbers, or strings:
    * Numbers are mapped to JavaScript numbers;
    * Otherwise the literal item is mapped to a JavaScript string.
